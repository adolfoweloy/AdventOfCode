# aoc2021

AoC2021 this year is my excuse to play a bit of Haskell with my beginner skills with this language.
I am not sure I will be able to complete all the challenges, but I will post what I can do with this interesting programming language here.

To run these Haskell files, you can compile it with ghc or as I did with stack:
```
stack runhaskell day_<day_number_here>.hs
```

PS: I am not interested in write a dynamic, generic project, so expect to see hardcode things as the input filenames in each of the solutions.
