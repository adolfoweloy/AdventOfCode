# Advent of (Programming in Haskell)

I created this repository just to save my solutions in Haskell to [AoC](https://adventofcode.com). My intention writing these solutions in Haskell is to practice functional programming with a strict FP language. If you read my solutions you may find them all prone to all sorts of improvements and that's fair to me. This repo is just a small lab of FP that I use around December whenever playing with AoC, so:
- don't expect to see advanced concepts of the language in action. 
- don't Haskell code written in the most effective way

### How to run the solutions

I'm not using any project build tool since this is not the focus of my practice around Haskell.

To run these Haskell files, you can compile it with ghc or as I did with stack:
```
stack runhaskell <year>/day_<day_number_here>.hs
```
